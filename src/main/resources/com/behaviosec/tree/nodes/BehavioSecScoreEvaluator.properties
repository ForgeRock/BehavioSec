nodeDescription=BehavioSec Score Evaluator
minScore=Minimum Score
minScore.help=Minimum acceptable score, score is a numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, that indicates to what \
  degree the timing data in the session matches the timing data in the trained Profile. A high Behavioral Score means\
   there is little difference between the behavior in the session and the userâ€™s Profile.
minConfidence=Minimum Confidence
minConfidence.help=Minimum acceptable confidence, confidence is a value that represents the quantity of data that has\
   been stored in a Profile and is available to check against the user. The higher the Confidence value, the more data is available to check against the behavior
presented in a given session.
maxRisk=Maximum Risk Score
maxRisk.help=Maximum acceptable risk score, is a numerical measure of potentially fraudulent activity during the \
  course of a user session. It can be a number greater than or equal to zero. A Risk value in the range of 0-100 is \
  considered minimal risk, while over 100 is high risk and should be investigated for fraud.
allowInTraining=Allow in Training
allowInTraining.help=Allow in Training, indicates that the user Profile is still in the Training phase. If enabled, \
  the Score and Risk will be ignored and the node will evaluate to true. 
groupName=BehavioSec
groupName.help=This Score evaluation module allows you to specify the Behavioral Score, Confidence, and Risk levels. \
  Anything below the specified values will fail. It also allows you to control the outcome for users whose Profiles are still in the Training phase.
